## The application of SVM and Perceptron
# 1.SVM: To find a classifer to Maxmize the margin  
# 2.Perceptron: To find a classifier to minimize the cost function
   Q1: Read the File.  
   Q2a: List the names of files and find the occurance of first features.  
   Q2b: Count the occurance of features in the list, and make them into a martrix.  
   Q3: Do PCA transfomation and plot the score.  
   Q4: Use SVM and Perceptron to learn the features and plot the classifer on the figure.  
   Q5: Use testset to find the accuracy.
